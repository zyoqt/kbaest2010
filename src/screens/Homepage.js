      <p>Karvill Badminton Aficionados (KBA) is a tight-knit community of badminton enthusiasts that has been thriving for over 14 years. More than just a sports group, KBA is a family that supports each other in times of need, with guidance from Rizalina "Sally" Berganio-Luna and Francisco "Jojo" Luna. Their leadership has helped shape KBA into a place where members connect, grow, and thrive together.</p>
      <p>Beyond badminton, KBA serves as a sanctuary for those seeking meaning in life. Like a fishing net, it offers support to those feeling lost, helping them rediscover their purpose. Rooted in faith, KBA follows Godâ€™s teachings, providing not only a community for sports but also emotional and spiritual support for all its members.</p>
